      <div class="title">Post-career Transition</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>A career in sport is something a lot of people dream of. Having sport, something you love and enjoy doing, as your job is often seen as a dream. But the career in sport is not all that fun and enjoyable. Along with problems that come during your career retirement is usually a very hard time for sportsmen. Career of an athlete is not long lasting, and very few find themselves jobs in the sport after retirement. It is sometimes very hard for athletes to find new interest and job after retiring from sport and might lead to them feeling purposeless and not being able to find a place for themselves.</p>
        <p> However, there are also some positive cases. For Katie Greeves finding a job wasn’t as big of a struggle. Before going into being a full-time professional athlete she worked part-time as a teacher and found it enjoyable for her. Before 2016 Olympics when she knew that no matter what she is retiring after competition she looked for the teaching jobs she could take after the Olympics and applied to them. It made her retirement smoother than it could be.</p>

        <p>After you retire as an athlete you are not only changing your job, but you also need to adjust to a completely different lifestyle. Life as an athlete is a constant training, performance at competition and thoughts about your career. It makes your life very busy, and it also gives you a sense of belonging and purpose in your life. After retirement from sport people usually get a lot of free time that they don’t know what to do with. It might make them feel lost, and it’s very important to find things which you can occupy that space with. Either it being a hobby, your family, friends or job.</p>
        <p>For Katie Greeves this aspect of retirement was something that is incredibly hard to deal with. According to her words her career was “15-16 years of having a purpose. And I think that is what you miss. You miss having a thing to get you out of bed every day, like the excitement and the fact that everything is focused on that one thing that was taken away is a loss of identity and the purpose is gone”.  For most athletes their career takes up a big part of their life. They usually start professional sport at the age of 15 or 16 and end their career in the mid-30s or early 40s. It is the time when you are most focused on your job and when you develop in your career the most. And after you cannot continue with what you were working on for that whole time it is very hard to find something new that you are passionate about.</p>

      <div class="title">Coping and Substances</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>While some athletes cope with their problems and retirement pretty well by seeking professional help, getting help from their family or finding a new passion, some people don’t find it that easy. Sport gives you a huge amount of dopamine and adrenaline. Because of that some people might find their life after retirement boring and purposeless. In attempts to bring joy back to their life some ex-athletes might refer to different substances, like drugs, alcohol, etc. Coping with their retirement this way their life simply goes down the curve. They no longer find a purpose in a job or any of their hobbies and would rather spend time having fun being under effect. Some athletes also use drugs to escape their struggles during their career.</p>
        <p>An example of an athlete who referred to drugs as a coping method with his problems is a legend who every football fan knows, Diego Maradona. There are several factors that contributed to his drug addiction. Firstly, Maradona living in a poor neighborhood in Buenos Aires, where drugs were common was early exposed to drugs. Secondly, as a football superstar Maradona faced high expectations from his performance. And as a consequence, Maradona sought refuge in drugs from all that pressure. Thirdly, during his career Maradona suffered from a lot of intense injuries. Because of his skill a lot of players tried to stop him by making physical contact, fouling or even injuring him. He also had a chronic knee problem. All of that made Maradona suffer from pain and discomfort throughout his career. To relief his pain and enhance his performance Maradona turned to drugs.</p>
