      <div class="title">Overuse Injuries</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p> Sport is usually considered to have positive effect on our health. Which is obviously true, but only to some extent. Our body has its limits. And pushing over those limits might result into our body not being to handle it. Professional athletes are usually required to overload themselves in different aspects of live. One of which is Physical health.</p>
        <p>In order to be elite in the sport you need to train until exhaustion all the time. You need to do things better than other and to put much more effort into it. Unfortunately, it often doesn’t end well for your physical wellbeing. Constantly trying to push your abilities over the top can lead to injuries. Overuse injuries are microtraumas which occur when the same part of body is overtrained.  Rafael Nadal is one of the most famous tennis players in the world. In his career Nadal has achieved a lot. However, on his way he suffered from overuse injuries because of the amount of work he had to put in. He has recurring knee issues with tendinitis in his patellar tendons; Injuries of his left wrist, his dominant hand for tennis; Back problems which affected his mobility and flexibility.</p>

      <div class="title">Major Injuries</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Athletes work their whole life in order to achieve greatness in the sport they are doing. And their whole journey can end in one moment. The high-speed, intensity and physical requirements of sports make athletes vulnerable for injuries. Some athletes can play with this pressure on their abilities. Some train their bodies to be durable, some have a naturally high durability. But everyone still has a possibility of getting injured. And a lot of athletes never come back the same.</p>
        <p>In basketball players are required to do a lot of quick and sharp movements. Basketball also involves a lot of contact between players. And in the moments when players are making a quick movement, change in direction or jump even the smallest mistake in coordination might be crucial. Derrick Rose was a very promising basketball player. He played as a guard for the Chicago Bulls and was seen as a new franchise player. Everyone thought that he would become one of the best players of all time and bring his team back to being the best team in NBA and winning a title. In fact, he took one of the major steps on his way of achieving greatness by being the youngest person to ever win MVP (Most Valuable Player) award ever. However, in one of the games against the Philadelphia 76ers Derrick Rose suffered an ACL injury in his left knee. That injury significantly impacted Rose’s career. He decreased in speed and agility, which he was known for and turned from a superstar into a role player.</p>

      <div class="title">Physical Exhaustion</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Athletes are not only required to train a lot of time, but also usually have very strict schedules. Workouts, flights, back-to-back competitions all make sportsmen very busy and leave very little time for rest. Physical exhaustion can lead to a variety of more serious problems. For example, cardiovascular issues.</p>
        <p>During intense physical activity the heart rate significantly increases in order to supply more oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. Prolonged periods of exercise without enough rest, which is hard to fit in the athlete’s schedule, can lead to a persistently elevated heart rates increasing the risk of heart-related issues. Elevated blood pressure supplied by heart can make arteries less flexible making it harder for blood to flow. This leads to significant risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. As an example of an athlete who suffered from that we can look at the case of Danish footballer, Christian Erikson. He collapsed during the 2020 UEFA European Championship. He didn’t have any contact with other players, and everyone was shocked by the situation. A medical team ran up to him and had to perform CPR. After that he was taken to nearby hospital where it was later confirmed that Eriksen had suffered a cardiac arrest. At the moment football has a big problem with the number of games that players have to participate in. Different organisations create more and more tournaments in order to make more money, and they are not very concerned about players. It leads to footballers having to play a few games a week, especially in the top clubs which participate in the national leagues, go to far stages of domestic cups and play in international competitions. The high number of games that footballers play leads to more and more players suffering from physical exhaustion and may lead to the cases like Erikson’s become more often.</p>
