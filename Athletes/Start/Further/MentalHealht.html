      <div class="title">Missing Out</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>The strict schedules of athletes not only impact their physical health but also have a huge impact on their mental health. Travel, travel and competitions demand a lot of time to be spent on. As a result, sportsmen may miss out on family events like birthdays, holidays, as well as opportunities to spend time with friends outside of their colleagues. The separation from people who are so close to them can lead to feeling of loneliness isolation and guilt for not being able to be there with them.</p>
        <p>In order to investigate this question a bit more I interview an ex-Olympic athlete, a silver medallist at a Women’s eight competition on 2016 Summer Olympics, Katie Greeves. I asked her if she has ever missed out on family events to what she said that it was happening all the time. This shows that in order to be good at the sport they are doing athletes have to sacrifice their personal life. Finding a balance between their professional and personal lives becomes a constant struggle. And a lot of athletes are not able to pursue it. Missing out may firstly only result into a short-term feeling of loneliness but if you have to cope with it for a long time it can lead to a much bigger problems like depression.</p>

      <div class="title">Identity Issues</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Besides being separated with the loved ones athletes also receive a lot of criticism about them from media and fans. Sport often becomes intertwined with their identity making them think of themselves the way others talk about. In addition to it there are a lot of problems that athletes have to deal with. Injuries, bad performances make them feel lost, sometimes purposeless. All these problems press on sportsmen mentality. </p>
        <p>Along with the problems which arise during their career, post-career challenges may be even harder to overcome for athletes. After the end of their career, they might feel like the part of them was taken away. As said by Katie Greeves post-retirement life affects your sense of identity a lot in a way that you don’t expect. With the amount of time spent on the sport by athletes it becomes a huge part of their lives and stop doing it might feel like losing a part of yourself. It might lead to sportsmen becoming introverted and closed from others. As well as them not seeing a purpose in their lives not knowing what to do and what they are interested in. In order to cope with these athletes usually seek help of professionals. In Katie Greeves’ case she had a year working with a post-retirement team which helped her to continue her life after quitting sport. She also had access to man-to-man meeting with doctors who could help her with injuries and mentally support her.</p>

      <div class="title">Feeling of Anxiety, Stress and Burnout</div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Athletes receive a lot of feedback about their performance. And in a lot of cases the feedback Is negative. One mistake can make you hated by the fans even if you were performing good all the other times. Especially on the big stages where one mistake might cost you your gold and dream you were trying to achieve your whole career. Because of that Athletes often have a feeling of anxiety and stress before performing. Constant pressure from audience and their own expectations of their performance might lead to burnout which is sometimes very hard to deal with.</p>
        <p>For athletes it is very important to be able to cope with the pressure when it becomes overwhelming. Talking to Katie Greeves about it found out that in order to cope with it she tried to distract herself. She spent time talking to her family about it, studying or working on finding a job after sport career. We should also take into account the number of athletes who don’t end-up making it to big stages like Olympic Games. And in their cases the mental slopes that they had to go through, the time wasted on their career and the pressure put on them might not be worth the potential toll it takes on their mental and physical health.</p>
        <p>According to Katie there are also times in your career where you feel burned out. In her case, there were times when trainings became too much, once she had to skip the World Championship selection because of her back injury, which really damages your mental state as everything you were working for is at a stake.</p>
